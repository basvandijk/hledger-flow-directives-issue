A minimal reproducible case for: https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/issues/127.

It shows that [including manual transactions in `directives.journal`](https://github.com/basvandijk/hledger-flow-directives-issue/blob/master/directives.journal#L4-L10) causes them to be included in all generated journal files.

This is because https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/commit/0bcf667b24b030e30acee350c05dd69ba5ec20b5 replaced
`hledger import --dry-run --file directives.journal        file.csv --rules-file ...` with:
`hledger print            --file directives.journal --file file.csv --rules-file ...` meaning that all transactions from `directives.journal` will be printed and thus included in generated journal files.

Indeed when I [downgrade](https://github.com/basvandijk/hledger-flow-directives-issue/blob/master/flake.nix#L17-L18) to the parent of https://github.com/apauley/hledger-flow/commit/0bcf667b24b030e30acee350c05dd69ba5ec20b5 the issue doesn't happen.

So I guess I shouldn't include transactions in `directives.journal` and move them somewhere else. But where should manual transactions be included? I think I can't move them to `all-years.journal` because it mentions:

include directives.journal
